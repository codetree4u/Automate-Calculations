## Project Description

Automate the calculations for the loan portfolio summaries.

First, let's start with some calculations on a list of prices for 5 loans. 
1. Use the len() function to calculate the total number of loans in the list. 
2. Use the sum() function to calculate the total of all loans in the list. 
3. Using the sum() of all loans and the total number of loans, calculate the average loan price. 
4. Print all calculations with descriptive messages.
